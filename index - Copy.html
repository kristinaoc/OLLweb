                    <p> You've got a smartphone. Maybe even a proper camera. You take lots of photos of your family yourself.  You're not lacking in captured memories.  You don't need me to do that for you.  But you're wanting something extra special.  Something to commemorate this age, this stage, this occasion. </p>

                    <h3>Putting you in the frame</h3>

                    <p>You love taking photos, but you want a good one that you're in too!  I mean, you've tried. But then you get your arm fattened by perspective on the group selfie shot, or unattractive double chins from trying to pull back as far from the camera as you could. So you tried timer release, because a nice family group shot is important to you so you're going to put the effort in.  All spontenaity is lost and at least half of the family have stiff frozen smiles and at least one of you has blinked at the very moment the shutter was triggered.  Well, were just starting to blink actually, and so they have that weird eyes half closed look going on. </p>


                    <h3>You want photos that capture a moment </h3>

                    <p>These shots you take yourself are still important and have a place in your family history.  But that place is not on the wall or a gorgeous album on your coffee table.  They fall short of your  vision.  They aren't as gorgeous as you know your family really is.  </p>

                    <p>You want extraordinary shots.  You don't want to be thinking after a photo shoot "gee, I could have done better myself".  You want that gorgeous picture up on your wall. Or a fabulous album of all your images.</p>

                    <p>That's where I can help. </p>

<h3>It can't be time for Christmas stuff already can it?! </h2>

<p>Christmas is not all that far off.  Why not have a private Christmas-themed studio session to commemorate the season?  Especially good to send to family and friends you might not be able to visit this year (grr to covid-19).  The basic package includes your six favorite digital images for $95, and one 8x12" print.  You can add prints or even the most gorgeous metal ornaments.  All the information can be found on the <a href=https://www.oflightandlensphotography.com.au/client_area/christmas-sessions/> Christmas Session info</a> page.  </p>

<h3>My Girl - My Dress Sessions </h2>

<p>Has your wedding dress been sitting in the back of the closet since your big day?  Since you're too sentimental to get rid of it, but you really have no use for it? Use it to create beautiful new memories with a photo session of your daughter/s dressing up in it!  I mean, lets be real here, they are unlikely to want to wear it for their big day.  By then they will probably just get a good giggle out of how the style has dated!  But while they are still little that dress is the fanciest they have ever gotten close to!  A photo session in the studio is a whole heap of fun and will give gorgeous new memories of that special dress.     </p>

        <h2>What we do at Of Light and Lens Photography</h2>

                <p>At Of Light and Lens Photography I offer a range of photographic services, from studio portraits to informal lifestyle photography sessions.  I also specialise in dance photography, both in the studio and onstage.  For the business person, I offer product and personal branding and social media content building shoots.  Let me weave my magic with light to make you stand out from the crowd.   </p>



            </div>

            <div class="content-block">

                    <p> Photo sessions are on location or at my home studio.  Whatever works best for you.  I can even bring my pop-up studio to you! This is ideal if you'd love the studio look but can't travel to me, or want an extended shoot with a mix of studio and lifestyle images.  I'm based in Brisbane, and am happy to travel to the Gold and Sunshine Coasts and Ipswich. </p>

        <h3>So, are we a good fit?</h3>

        <p>We are probably a good fit if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You want quality photography. </li>
            <li>You want wall art and/or albums of your images.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If you're after any of these things, I'm probably not going to be able to meet your needs:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>You only want the digitals. </li>
            <li>You want....</li>
        </ul>
