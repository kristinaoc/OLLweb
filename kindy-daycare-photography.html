                    <h3>Is my style of kindy photography a good fit for your centre?</h3>

                    <ul>
                    <li>You want quality photography for your centre families. </li>
                    <li>You want a photographer who offers your families a choice of images and a range of purchasing options.</li>
                    <li>You don't want the hassle of collecting orders and money - you want the photographer to handle all this with an easy online system.  </li>
                    <li>You want your families to have a choice of quality products</li>
                    <li>You don't mind the idea of having your centre photos over a few days - in fact, now that I mention it, it's not such a bad idea!  Photo times are typically scheduled for mornings when the children are fresher, and it allows variable daily attendance to be catered for. </li>

                </ul>


                  

                    <h3>I'm not the right photographer for your centre if</h3>

                    <ul>
                    <li>You want a photographer who is really fast, spending only a super short time per child, and is only at the centre for a few short hours. <i>My style of photography and generating a gallery of quality images for each family to choose from takes a little extra time.</i></li>
                    <li>You want a commission on sales. <i>Commission on sales comes from your families' pockets.  I want to keep my prices affordable whilst still renumerating me for my time and expenses.  However, I have some great centre benefits that are independent of centre sales totals. </i></li>
                    <li>You want the cheapest price on kindy and daycare photography.  <i>My style of photography takes more of my time per child, both when taking the photographs and processing afterwards. I do charge more to cover my costs of providing a premium service.  </i></li>
                    <li>You only want a traditional single head shot of each child. <i>Sure, I can do this, but what I love about what I do is the chance to capture more than just one expression from each child. This lets their individual personality shine.  There is no obligation for parents to buy any images.  My approach ensures that, even if a parent only chooses to buy one image, that image will be a better image than I would achieve with a single snap because typically children relax in a slightly longer session as I establish a rapport and respond with more natural expressions.    </i></li>
