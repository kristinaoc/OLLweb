            <p>The three main phases of any photo session are the consultation, the photo shoot itself, and image selectin and delivery.  </p>

            <h2>Pre shoot consultation</h2>

            <p>Once you have booked and paid your deposit, a pre shoot consultation is arranged at a mutually convenient time.  This can be in person or over the phone, depending on your preference.  We can go over what your aims for the photo shoot, and discuss clothes, makeup, props, locations and shoot times to plan a photo shoot that will achieve the images you desire.  </p>

            <p>After the consultation, I'll email you a summary of everything we discussed so you don't have to worry about forgetting anything!</p>

            <h2>The Photo Shoot</h2>
            <p>Photo day!  It will be a heap of fun, don't worry.  I'll put you at ease.  We can listen to music, or not.  Dance, or not. (Actually, if it's a dance shoot you've booked, we <i>will</i> dance!)  We will experiment and get a bit silly, but, never fear - anything <i>too</i> silly will never see the light of day. Unless you want it to!</p>  
            
            <p>After we get the sillies out of our systems, everyone will relax and I can help you look your best for the camera.  </p>


<h2> Image delivery</h2>
            
            <p>Images are presented within 14 days of your shoot in my password protected <a href="https://oflightandlensphotography.pixieset.com/" > Pixieset hosted galleries</a>.  Here you can choose your package-included prints and digital downloads, and even add extras if you choose.  </p>

            <p>Delivery times for print products depends on the item.  There are longer lead times for some large display products and albums compared to standard lustre prints for example, however I aim to despatch your order within 14-21 days of receiving final confirmed order and payment.  </p>


            <h2>How to book</h2>

            <p><a href=mailto:kristina@kristina@oflightandlensphotography.com.au> Email me</a> to enquire or book.  You can pre-pay with Paypal using the links in the pricing information below, or I can invoice you.  A non-refundable $250 booking fee is due 14 days prior to the scheduled photo session.  This is deductable from the total package cost.  Balance of total package payment is due 14 days after the scheduled photo session, or upon placement of a print or print package order, whichever is sooner.  I have a mobile card reader to facilitate paying the balance in person by credit card if this is more convenient than online payment.  If a session must be rescheduled due to inclement weather or illness, the deposit is transferable provided maximum practicable notice is given.  View detailed Terms and Conditions <a href= >here</a>. </p>

            <h2>Photo package pricing</h2>

            <p>Portrait packages listed below may be used for families, children, pets, individuals or couples.  Dance shoot pricing depends on location requirements, with additional fees for professional studio hire particularly suited to the additional space required for dance photography, or specialist pop up studio equipment requirements.  </p>

            <p>Personal branding, product photography or web/social media content type shoots have separate pricing due to commercial usage licencing requirements.  Please <a href=emailto:kristina@oflightandlensphotography.com.au> enquire</a> for a tailored package that includes digital images formatted to your requirements and commercial use licencing. </p>

            <p>
                All packages include: 

            </p>


            <ul>

                <li>Choice of studio or on location (pop up studio extra fee).</li>
