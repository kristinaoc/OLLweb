            <h2>Entry 1:  My journey begins</h2>

            <div class="content-area-grid">

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p> It's been a year since I decided to become a Professional Photographer.  And as they say, what a year it's been. I thought I'd start off my blogging with a brief history of how I got to here:  with my fresh Diploma, a shiny new website, ready to face the world!  </p>
             
                    
                    <p><div class="accent-text">"What type of photography do you want to specialise in?" "You don't want to be confusing to your customers do you?"  "A jack of all trades, master of none?"  "People want a specialist."  "Does anyone really use professional photographers anymore?"</div>  </p>
                    
                    <p>This past year I've felt a pressure to know where I want to end up.  It's made me second guess myself as I feel my way to finding what I truly love. Although it makes perfect sense to have a clear goal, I'm not sure what kind of images are my favourite to create.  I'm torn between the ethos of surrendering and trusting the universe, and knowing that good things don't just happen - you've got to chase what you want.  "Fake it till you make it." say some. But I can't fake it.  It goes against my nature.  In fact, I can have made it and still feel like there's a mountain of improvement to do!  </p>

                    <p>So this is a look back at what's led me to here.  None of this pretending I've been here knowing exactly what I've been about forever.  And why do you want to know this about your photographer?  Well, I hope that it will make me a little more human.  Help you trust me with your story.  Trust me to capture your special moments, or convey your story to the world.  No, I don't have twenty years experience as a professional photographer. But I've got plenty of skill and oodles of passion.    </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>My love for photography started with being entranced looking back at old family photos.  I remember playing with Polaroid photos at Nanny's.  Watching as the magic unfolded and the images appeared.  Then I had my own little 110 cassette camera.  And an automatic 35mm camera when I was in year 12 and off to Science Summer School.  I embraced the arrival of digital by spending a small fortune on a Kodak 1MP digital camera in 2000.  And then proceeded to take photos on even lower resolution on a trip to Austria for work, because compact flash cards were so very expensive.  I've still got some of those early CF cards.  Not my very first 4KB and 8KB ones, I gave those to my brother with the camera when I upgraded.  But I do have some others which cost me more thant the 32 and 64 GB ones I now have did!  </p>

<!--add picture of CF cards here-->


                    <p>As the years rolled by, technology improved.  With my first digital SLR I was able to really play with all that technical stuff like aperture that I'd read about, but which I'd never trusted myself to get right enough to invest in an SLR film camera.   I worried it would be a lot of expensive developing in my learning curve.  Digital of course offered that wonderful instant feedback.  Mind you, at the time the extra price probably meant I coould have learnt with film more cheaply overall!  </p>

                    <p>My photography hobby bubbled away in the background.  I continued my day job in the petroleum industry, first as a chemist and then as a supply planner.  And photography was there on the side Vying for my creative energies with other hobbies like cake decorating, bellydance and clay sculpture.  And then children stole all my energy but rekindled the passion for photographs as a record of family history. </p> 
                    
                    <p>Feeling stale in my career when yet another restructure rolled through my department, I jumped.  I jumped before even actually deciding it was photography that I was going to pursue.  But the stirrings were there.  After all, I attended one of Andrew Merefield's "How to Shoot People for Profit" sessions late in 2017.  Even if it wasn't until early 2018 that on a whim that I attended the Torrens Uni open day! </p>

                    <p>I decided to kick-start this new phase with some formal training.  Sure, there's so much available on line these days.  And many excellent photographers are self taught.  But, nothing beats face to face instruction in my opinion.  And not to mention the fact that actual assignment deadlines that come along with formal study prevent that tendency to put things off!  Especially with two small kids, I needed deadlines to keep me focussed!  </p>

                    <p>So I signed up with Billy Blue College of Design at Torrens University.  I did a Diploma of Photo Imaging.  One year long, three trimesters full time.  I admit it.  I thought it would be pretty cruisy.  I thought I'd have plenty of time for non-assignment related shoots on the side.  Ha ha ha.  But, the intensity was a good thing.  I learned heaps.  Sometimes I was tempted to reduce the subject load - but then my awesome powers of procrastination would have kicked in, and really just stretched that phase out!  </p>

                    <p>That brings me to today.  Despite all that learning, there is still so much to learn.  So many different things to try.  What do I want to specialise in?  The problem is, I'm spoiled for choice!  So I'm going against conventional opinion and keeping things a bit general for a while.  Letting myself try more things, rather than trying to constrain myself to boxes that I think might win me more customers.  I'm going to be open to new ideas and experimentation.  That is going to yield far better images and capture more passion than trying to fit inside the box of convention.  </p>
