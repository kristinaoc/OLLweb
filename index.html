            <h2>Perfectly Pleasing Portraits of People and Pets</h2>

            <p> Hi!  I'm Kristina, photographer at Of Light and Lens Photography.  I'm Brisbane based and specialise in capturing images that make an impact. </p>

                    <p>I could have included this with "Family". Because pets are part of the family after all!  But these special family members deserve some galleries all of their own. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                   

                    <p>I know you want more than just a photo</p>

                    <p> You take lots of photos of your family yourself.  You're not lacking in captured memories.  You don't need me to do that for you.  But a wow image that deserves pride of place up on the wall?  Well, that magic shot eludes you.  One that has everyone in at the same time?  Yes, well, you do try to make some of those.  But then you get your arm fattened by perspective on the group selfie shot, or unattractive double chins from trying to pull back as far from the camera as you could. So you tried timer release, because a nice family group shot is important to you so you're going to put the effort in.  All spontenaity is lost and at least half of the family have stiff frozen smiles and at least one of you has blinked at the very moment the shutter was triggered.  Well, were just starting to blink actually, and so they have that weird eyes half closed look going on. </p>

                    <p>These shots you take yourself are still important and have a place in your family history.  But that place is not on the wall or a gorgeous album on your coffee table.  They fall short of your  vision.  They aren't as gorgeous as you know your family really is.  </p>

                    <p>You don't want ordinary shots.  You don't want to be thinking after a photo shoot "gee, I could have done better myself".  You want that gorgeous picture up on your wall. Or a fabulous album of all your images.</p>
                
                    

                </div>

                <div class="content-block">

                        <p>My trick for fabulous photos is playing with the light.  My favorite types of photo shoots are at sunset, where nature provides the most gorgeous light, or in the studio where I can manipulate the light to create my own type of magic.</p> 


                        <p>Please take some time to browse my galleries of images on this site, and be sure to pop over and take a look at my <a href=https://www.facebook.com/oflightandlensphotography>Facebook</a> and <a href=https://www.instagram.com/oflightandlensphotography>Instagram</a> pages.

           <!--         <p>I also arrange regular <a href=themedminishoots.html>themed mini-shoot</a> days.  This is a great opportunity for some fabulous fun images with great savings compared to a normal full photo session.  </p>

                <p>At Of Light and Lens Photography I offer a range of photographic services, from studio portraits to informal lifestyle photography sessions.  I also specialise in dance photography, both in the studio and onstage.  For the business person, I offer product and personal branding and social media content building shoots.  Let me weave my magic with light to make you stand out from the crowd.   </p>



            </div>

            <div class="content-block">

                    <p> Photo sessions are on location or at my home studio.  Whatever works best for you.  I can even bring my pop-up studio to you! This is ideal if you'd love the studio look but can't travel to me, or want an extended shoot with a mix of studio and lifestyle images.  I'm based in Brisbane, and am happy to travel to the Gold and Sunshine Coasts and Ipswich. </p>

        <h3>So, are we a good fit?</h3>

        <p>We are probably a good fit if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You want quality photography. </li>
            <li>You want wall art and/or albums of your images.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If you're after any of these things, I'm probably not going to be able to meet your needs:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>You only want the digitals. </li>
            <li>You want....</li>
