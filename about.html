                    <h3>Why daycare, dance, and doggies?</h3>

                    <p>I'll be the first to admit, I've got a bit of a mix going on here.  But look again.  They have a very important thing in common - gorgeous and important subjects!  Your children, your family, your pets, your hobbies and your sport are all precious parts of our lives.  </p>

                    <p>Looking back on old family photographs is a pleasure.  And to hand down the pleasure that looking back on old photos brings needs us to take and preserve more family photos. I have two gorgeous children of my own, and I can barely believe how fast they change.  Little kids are so cute.  Apparently it's something to do with survival!  I admit it, "lucky they're cute" has been uttered by me on occasion! I think school and daycare photos are a great chronicle of childhood years, and I have embarked upon Daycare and Kindy photography in an effort to provide truly great photos of these fleeting years in your child's life.</p>

                    <p>I love my cat.  Even if he won't let us get a dog. So I have to make do by photographing other people's instead.  Oh, and I will photograph cats too.  Spike has given me plenty of practice in cat approved photography techniques.  And other pets.  Sometimes it can take a bit of time, but it's so worth the patience. I am also a big believer that pets are part of the family, and they totally deserve my efforts to take fantastic shots of them! </p>

            <p>And finally - dance - how did that bit sneak in?  No, I didn't study ballet as a child.  I didn't get involved in dance till an adult, when I took up Middle Eastern Dance (yes, better known as belly dance).  The beauty of the dancers, their costumes and their motion is somewhat of a late love compared to many little girls.  However, to capture those elements into a timeless frame of beauty is a challenge I relish.  </p>
