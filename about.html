                    <p> Hi! I'm Kristina! Photographer at Of Light and Lens Photography.</p>

                    <h2>What brings me here?</h2>

                    <h3>A tale of two Chemistries</h3>

                    <p>Once upon a time, I went to uni, and got a degree in Chemistry. And I went and worked in industry for nearly 20 years...</p>

                    <p>...and then...</p>

                    <p>...I decided I preferred working with that OTHER type of chemistry.  </p>

                    <p>I mean the type that comes from people.  People interacting, telling their stories.  Which creates beautiful magic better than in any lab. </p>

                    <p>Now I get to marry the scientific and the creative to produce true magic with my tools, magic "of light and lens".  </p>

                  

     
                    <img src="resources/images/me-and-my-family.jpg" alt="Kristina and her family at Pandanus Beach">
                    

                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                       

                    
                    <img src="resources/images/me-at-beach-by-di.jpg" alt="Kristina at Pandanus Beach">
            
              
                

                    <p>I love to capture all sorts of images. But I do have to say my favourites are families, including the furry family members, children, and dancers.  The thing I love having great photos of myself are also the things I'd love to photograph for you.     </p>

                    <h3>Why daycare, dance, and doggies?</h3>

                    <p>I'll be the first to admit, I've got a bit of a mix going on here.  But look again.  They have a very important thing in common - gorgeous subjects!  Your children, your family, your pets - all precious parts of our lives.  </p>

                    <p>I have two gorgeous children of my own, and I can barely believe how fast they change.  And little kids are so cute.  Apparently it's something to do with survival!  I have two children of my own, and, I admit it, "lucky they're cute" has been uttered by me on occasion! </p>

                </div>



            </div>


            <p>Looking back on old family photographs is a pleasure for me.  A pleasure that needs us to take and preserve more family photos.  </p>

            <p>Daycare photography lets me capture images where your little ones let their personalities shine.  A great record of a fast changing time of their lives.  </p>

            <p>I am also a big believer that pets are part of the family, and they totally deserve my efforts to take fantastic shots of them!</p>

            <p>And finally - dance - how did that bit sneak in?  No, I didn't study ballet as a child.  I didn't get involved in dance till an adult, when I took up Middle Eastern Dance (yes, better known as belly dance).  The beauty of the dancers, their costumes and their motion is somewhat of a late love compared to many little girls.  However, to capture those elements into a timeless frame of beauty is a challenge I relish.  </p>


            <p>Thanks to Di East at <a href="https://www.photoprosecreative.com.au/" >Photo Prose Creative</a> for the photos of me and my family. </p>
